# RedCrow Crowdfunding Startup Assessment based on Crunchbase dataset

### Overview: 
The project sponsor Redcrow is an equity crowdfunding platform that acts as an intermediary for healthcare startups to gain investors and the healthcare professionals and stakeholders to multiply and boost innovation in their domain of expertise. The startups hosted in RedCrow can either be introduced via a Partner or be submitted through the Discover Supernovas process. While the whole standing for eligibility to be on the INVEST platform lies with the Investment Committee, the crowd or the accredited investors may also voice their opinion and provide advice on how these early-stage startups could improve. 
Redcrow currently assesses the startups on various business and scientific metrics including business model, clinical team, business team and many more against other startups on RedCrow each on a score of 1-5. They showcase the group competition, for example, in the Amnion Life Diligence Report, it is mentioned that the Average Combined Comprehensive score is 11% lower than other medical device startups on Redcrow. And then go on to provide the questionnaires and responses of the startup to articulate the objective and how well-informed they are in the planning and utilization. But can this be scored as well? Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged to gain insights from these responses in addition to the surveys and competition evaluations. My project proposal will address this and how from the feedback of the accredited investor or industry expert in the "crowd" we can evaluate the sentiment too in addition to the score and therefore further secure the investors' interest.
The project schedule will be defined from project proposal agreement , data acquisition and understanding, applying analytical models , result evaluation and business recommendations. 


### Project Objective:
Our objective is to help Redcrow utilize predictive models to assess the success or failure of startup.
We have built a Minimum Viable Project which is a web application built in Flask and deployed with docker on AWS EC2 instance. 
The idea is to take as input the feature values for the startup company under assessment and predict the success probability on logistic regression model in the background. We also provide a dashboard that visualizes the data, business insights and feature importance on top of which the model was derived.
